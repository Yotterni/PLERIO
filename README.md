# PLERIO: Protein - [low expressed] RNA interaction oracle

## Introduction
The study of protein-RNA interactions (RPIs) is critical for understanding many cellular processes. Existing experimental protocols for RPI discovery are biased toward highly expressed RNAs because no normalization is applied to the expression rates of RNAs. However, many regulatory RNAs are low-expressed and information about them is likely to be missing from the experimental data. It is therefore hoped that deep learning models will be able to find binding patterns between certain proteins and RNAs, and can be used to screen low-expressed RNAs for potential protein-binding ones.
